Ganesh Jayakumar 

Salesforce Technical Architect | Developing Full Stack Skills with Focus on AI


Professional Summary:

With over 15 years in the IT / Services industry, and 7 years into the Salesforce ecosystem, I am passionate about leveraging my diverse experience to solve business challenges and drive innovation.

My expertise covers a broad range of Salesforce applications including Sales, Service, Field Service Lightning, Revenue Cloud, CPQ, and Experience Cloud. I'm also adept in integrating Gen AI features to automate Salesforce solutions, enhancing efficiency and productivity across Sales, Service, and Revenue clouds.

As an experienced Architect, I facilitate technical/functional architecture meetings and product grooming sessions. I love preparing high-level design documents and architecture diagrams, and I have a knack for creating scalable solutions.

My background spans multiple industries such as Telecom, Finance, Healthcare, and Retail. This breadth of experience enables me to quickly adapt and bring industry-specific insights to my consulting engagements.

I have hands-on experience with Continuous Integration and Delivery tools like Git, GitHub, Butbucket for Version Control and Copado for DevOps . My technical chops extend to Salesforce Apex Development, Lightning Web Components, Salesforce Flow Builder, App Builder, Experience Builder, and Aura Components.

Integration is my forte. I have successfully integrated Salesforce with enterprise systems using REST-based web services, Platform Events, Streaming API, and MuleSoft. My expertise also includes creating custom reports and dashboards using Salesforce Report Builder and Einstein Analytics.

By automating Salesforce using AI Prompt Engineering, Einstein for Developers, and Gen AI integrations, I help companies scale and increase their profits.

Besides Salesforce, I'm honing my skills in open source technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Java, Python and Springboot MicroServices. This has led me to exciting projects including B2B Healthcare website.
